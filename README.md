# onepirate-typescript

Thanks for stopping by! This project is an adaptation of the Material-UI [onepirate theme](https://material-ui.com/store/items/onepirate/) to Typescript, using [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) as a harness for building and testing. This code is distributed using the MIT license so feel free to use it in your own projects.

I decided to open source this work while building the [Web Field Guide](https://field-guide.web.app/) and realizing it might be a nice contribution to the broader community. If you found this helpful please check out the [field guide](https://field-guide.web.app/) or drop me an [email](mailto:andrew@wheelhorse.io).

I tried to change as little as possible about the original implementation when working on this adaptation. I did end up adding react-router-dom to the project for navigation, but otherwise the only changes you should notice are places where I've added types and hints for Typescript compiler.

## Building and running locally

Once you clone this repo you can use `npm install` and the standard create-react-app scripts to run it locally:

```
C:\onepirate-typescript> npm install
...
C:\onepirate-typescript> npm run build
...
C:\onepirate-typescript> npm start
```
